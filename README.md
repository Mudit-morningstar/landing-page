# landing-page
website landing page design to text html and design changes.

Created a landing page from an image and color specifications.

The aim is to get comfortable with css and more specifically flexbox and how to align items using it.


Future Plans:
1. Is to add real picture and info.
2. Make a meaningful webpage out of it instead of just a template.
